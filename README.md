# 📌 Affiliate Referral Management System

A web-based platform that manages affiliate referrals, quotation tracking, commission calculations, and tax deductions for partnered affiliates.

## ✉️ SMTP Environment Variables

The application reads SMTP configuration from environment variables to avoid committing secrets.
Set the following variables on your server (example for bash):

```bash
export SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
export SMTP_PORT=587
export SMTP_SECURE=tls        # use 'ssl' or 'tls'
export SMTP_USERNAME=your@domain.com
export SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
export MAIL_FROM=no-reply@yourdomain.com
export MAIL_FROM_NAME="Your Company"
```

On Apache you can set these with `SetEnv` in the virtual host config, or with a systemd service file for PHP-FPM. For deployments, prefer server-level environment provisioning or a secrets manager.
